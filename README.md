Hi Humans!

Today is 19 June 2020.

I just successfully defended my PhD dissertation in 8 June 2020.
I am about to complete the combined Master and Doctoral program at Sejong University within 3.5 years.
Should I stay at Sejong University for 01 year postdoc and then a faculty position (Assistant Professor)?
Or should I go to other universities for opportunities to explore new things and meet excellent researchers?

Yep, this is the first time I create a repository in Github!
