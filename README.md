Hi Humans!

Today is 19 June 2020. I am about to decide an important decision about my career.
I just successfully defended my PhD dissertation in 8 June 2020. I am about to complete the combined Master and Doctoral program at Dept. of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Sejong University within three and a half years.
Now I am about to deciding to stay 01 year at Sejong for postdoc and after that will be a faculty position (Assitant Professor) or to leave Sejong to take a good offer other universities.
Anyway, everything is clear in the next two months. I will follow my heart and logic mind when making the decision!

Ah! This note is just for trying to use Github for the very first time!
